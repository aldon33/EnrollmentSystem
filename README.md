<h1>Enrollment Software and System</h1>

This Enrollment System program will take inputs of the user's student info such as name, details, and academic placings. The program will process the inputted information and assign the student their own student number and a customizable class scedule in the form of an excel worksheet and a receipt. It is intended to be distributed to schools to automate and make their admission system more accessible. The schools would have the students use this program in order to make the enlistment process easier.

Currently, the program uses Javafx with itextpdf for writing .pdf files. The program is currently in progress and we are planning on integration Apache POI in reading/writing Excel files and MySQL through Laragon in managing the database.
